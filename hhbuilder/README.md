Household builder
=================

This application captures information about a household applying
for health insurance coverage by doing the following:

* Validate data entry (age is required and > 0, relationship is required)
* Add people to a growing household list
* Remove a previously added person from the list
* Display the household list in the HTML as it is modified
* Serialize the household as JSON upon form submission as a (fake) trip to the server
